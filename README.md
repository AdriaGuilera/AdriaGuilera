# 👋 Hi there, I'm Adrià Guilera

I'm a software engineering student and junior full-stack developer from Barcelona, focused on building useful products powered by AI.

I enjoy creating tools that automate workflows, simplify problems, and make technology feel useful in everyday life — from AI agents and RAG systems to mobile and web apps.

My philosophy is simple: build things, learn fast, and keep improving.

Outside of tech, you’ll find me at the gym or fishing by the sea.
