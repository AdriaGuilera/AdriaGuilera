I'm a software engineering student and junior full-stack developer passionate about building practical products powered by AI.

I enjoy creating tools that automate workflows and solve real problems — from AI agents and RAG systems to scalable web and mobile apps.

My philosophy is simple: build useful things, keep learning, and ship fast.

Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me at the gym or fishing by the sea
